Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

When the sum2DArray function is called, the execution order based on the console logs will be as follows:

1. "Sum called ... " is logged immediately upon function invocation, indicating the start of the promise's execution.
2. "returning from sum" is logged next, showing that the function has set up the promise and is exiting, returning the promise object. This occurs before the setTimeout callback has had a chance to execute because of the asynchronous nature of setTimeout.
3. The JavaScript event loop will then handle the setTimeout callback, and once it's ready (almost immediately, due to the timeout being 0), it will execute the callback.
4. Inside the callback, after the sum is calculated, "resolving ... " is logged just before calling resolve(sum) for a valid 2D array input, or "rejecting ... " is logged before calling reject('BAD INPUT: Expected array as input') for invalid input.
5. Finally, the .then() or .catch() attached to the promise will log either "Sum: [result]" or "Error: [error message]" based on whether the promise was resolved or rejected.
